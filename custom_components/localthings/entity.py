    Explicit exists_fn takes priority. Otherwise, if the entity has a field,
    require that field to be present in the resource rep so that optional
    fields on shared resources don't create phantom entities.

    A stub rep (is_stub_rep — /device/0's "resource exists, no data fetched
    yet" marker) is included anyway so it can be populated by sub-polls. A
    genuinely empty {} rep is included too by this default gate -- whether
    empty means "not populated yet" or "permanently unsupported" needs
    per-field domain knowledge this generic gate doesn't have: /alarms/vs/0's
    {} is fridge.py's documented *normal* no-alarm state (see
    _active_alarm_codes), not an absence signal, and it's far from the only
    resource like that. Only a capability whose author has actually verified
    a field is genuinely never populated on unsupported hardware opts into
    stricter gating with its own is_stub_rep-based exists_fn (see
    common.ENERGY_METER, issue #127) -- this default stays permissive.

    `bound.href` is already the *actual* href (issue #177 -- see
    BoundEntity/SubUnit), so the direct cache lookup below is correct as-is;

    raw snapshot, same rule as everywhere else a whole-resources-dict scan
    happens (coordinator.canonical_resources) -- this is a free function, not

"""Diagnostics support for Local Things.

Downloadable from Settings > Devices & Services > this integration's
device > the menu > Download diagnostics. This is what the Repairs issue
(raised in coordinator.py when capability coverage is incomplete) points
users at: a redacted snapshot of the device's raw /device/0 state, plus
enough version/coverage metadata to reproduce and diagnose the gap.
